## 🧪 How It Works

- HTML structures the content and sections.
- CSS handles:
  - Responsive layout via media queries
  - Grid/Flexbox for layout components
  - Styling for interactivity (hover, transitions)
- Contact form uses `mailto:` or external services like [Formspree](https://formspree.io) or [Getform](https://getform.io)
